# searchredux3
Edit 3 of the search repository. Now with several more features. 
<h1><b>The CSS is inside of the APP folder</b></h1>

This project is pretty much the third revision of a sample app I've been working on. It allows a user to search for a therpaist
based on name, rate, and shows the color/category that the therapists provides (there will be a "color legend" for reference
next time).

There's also a form section that allows perpsective therapists to list their names, rates and category services, but a server
is needed to save results, as well as some "pending" function to allow for the credential verification to occur. 

Feel free to message me with any questions, and check out my blog: http://codegirlnyc.wordpress.com
